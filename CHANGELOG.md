# Changelog

All notable changes to cli-semaphore are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Cadence (clarified per Surveyor review of v0.2.0):

- **Minor bumps** (`0.1.0` → `0.2.0`) carry **feature batches**.
  Strict semver would let backward-compatible additions ride patch
  bumps; we lift them to minor so an operator reading the version
  number knows "something genuinely new shipped." Minor bumps MAY
  break compatibility while we settle the post-MVP shape; the
  CHANGELOG entry calls out any break explicitly.
- **Patch bumps** (`0.2.0` → `0.2.1`) carry **bug-only fixes and
  policy corrections** — including default-behaviour changes that
  fix a bug class (e.g. v0.2.1's fail-loud drift policy). Patch
  bumps avoid removing or renaming existing fields/flags.
- **`0.x.y`** signals pre-1.0 instability. See `[Unreleased]`'s
  1.0 trigger discussion for the criteria we'd want before the
  major bump.

Run `claude-msg --version` to see what's installed.

## [Unreleased]

### Notes for 1.0 trigger (Surveyor review of v0.2.0)

Before bumping to 1.0 we want **K=3 release stability across all
public surfaces** — MCP tool schemas, CLI subcommand args/flags/exit
codes, `--format json` shapes, the database schema, and the public
Go API for `discover` / `store` / `tmuxio` packages — AND a
deprecation policy committed (post-1.0 breaks require a deprecation
cycle: deprecate in N.x, remove in N+1.0) AND the
Binnacle-absorb-or-coexist decision settled. Tracked informally
here until it becomes actionable.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Q(a): exact-match alias ambiguity in canonical resolution.** The
  Pass-1 exact-match logic in
  `discover.Walker.{LookupByName,PaneAgentName}WithCanonicals`
  walked canonicals in slice order and returned the first hit. When
  two canonicals shared an alias (or one canonical's name was
  another's alias), the resolver silently picked by slice order
  instead of flagging ambiguous. New `exactMatches` helper collects
  ALL canonical matches; >1 returns ambiguous=true.
- **Q(a): registration-time alias collision rejection.** New
  `store.ErrAliasCollision`. `SetAliases` / `AddAlias` now reject
  cross-canonical collisions at registration time (an alias already
  claimed as another agent's name OR as another agent's alias). The
  `semaphore.register` MCP handler surfaces the error verbatim so
  the operator knows immediately. Self-rebind (re-adding the agent's
  own alias) stays idempotent.

### Changed

- **Q(b): drift-ambiguous + drift-unrecoverable now MarkFailed by
  default.** Previously these paths logged WARN and delivered to the
  drifted (or ambiguous) pane — re-creating the silent-bad-delivery
  class for autonomous receivers (the 2026-05-31 misdelivery
  scenario). v0.2.1 changes the default: MarkFailed surfaces the
  issue immediately to the sender. New `--drift-soft-fail` flag
  preserves the pre-v0.2.1 behaviour for ops that need it.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- `--version` flag on `claude-msg` (with `-v` / `version` aliases).
  Built-time stamping via `-ldflags` from `git describe`. Bare
  `go build` reports `dev`.
- Pre-delivery silent-drift detection (#37). The mailman now reads
  the registered pane's `--resume` argument before delivery; if it
  doesn't match the expected agent, runs discover to find where the
  agent moved to, updates the registry, and retries on the new pane.
  Closes the silent-misdelivery gap surfaced 2026-05-31.
- Discover canonical-name + alias resolution (#38). `agents` table
  gains an `aliases` column. `semaphore.register` accepts an optional
  `alias` field. Resolution order: exact canonical → exact alias →
  case-insensitive substring fallback. Ambiguous matches are logged
  rather than guessed.
- `store.SetAliases` / `store.AddAlias` (idempotent).
- `discover.Walker.PaneAgentName` (raw, no canonicals).
- `discover.Walker.LookupByNameWithCanonicals` and
  `PaneAgentNameWithCanonicals` for canonical-aware lookup.

### Changed

- The mailman serve loop now opts into the silent-drift guard via
  `serveOpts.DriftCheckDisabled` (default off in production, set
  true by tests that don't fake `ListPanesWithPID`).
- Probes are now backspaced on `DeltaTUINoise` so they don't
  accumulate in the input box during long agent-busy stretches
  (cd969ea — was visible to operator as "probe creep").


## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-31

Initial tagged release. The repository contains the full MVP plus
two days of post-MVP hardening; this tag is the baseline going
forward, not a "first release" cut. The list below is intentionally
condensed — see git log for full audit.

### Core (MVP, M1-M7)

- SQLite store package: schema migration, WAL pragmas, agents +
  messages CRUD (#2).
- `send` subcommand with cap enforcement + JSON contract (#3).
- `inbox` + `status` subcommands (#4).
- `agents` + `whoami` discovery subcommands (#15).
- tmux delivery primitive: named-buffer paste + post-paste
  verification (#5).
- `serve` mailman daemon: loop, orphan recovery on startup (#6).
- systemd template unit + per-agent journal logging (#7).
- `pause` / `resume` operator controls (#8).
- `reset --confirm` for wedged-state recovery (#9).
- `--reply-to` flag + threaded headers (#10).
- `log --thread <id>` inspection (#11).
- Boot-time pane discovery (#12).
- Install script + alcatraz-infra integration (#14).
- MCP subcommand: native semaphore.* tools (#16).

### Post-MVP

- Identity precedence helper: explicit override / `$CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME`
  / `$TMUX_PANE`→registry (#27).
- `claude-msg control` CLI subcommand mirroring `semaphore.control`
  (#26).
- Whitelisted control commands with two-axis (self/peer) scope
  (#24): `compact`, `rename`, `cost`, `help`,
  `mcp-enable-semaphore`, `mcp-disable-semaphore` (self-only after
  scope flip), `mcp-restart-semaphore` (peer-safe macro).
- `semaphore.message_status` + `claude-msg track <id>` for delivery
  state (#31).
- Atomic cap enforcement: `_txlock=immediate` + in-transaction depth
  check; `ErrRecipientQueueFull` / `ErrSenderBacklogFull` sentinels
  (#29).
- Pre-delivery quiet-pane gate (probe-and-watch). Four-way verdict:
  Quiet / InputActivity / TUINoise / ProbeMissing. Input row
  identified by where the probe landed (not cursor_y). Probes
  cleaned up on every exit path. Watchdog-aware sleeps so long
  backoffs don't trip WatchdogSec (#30, #32, hotfixes 5a0f0ee
  through cd969ea).
- Verify-after-Enter soft-fail: `ErrUnverifiedDelivery` returns when
  paste/Enter mechanically completed but the token wasn't surfaced
  within ~5s. Mailman marks delivered + WARN rather than failed
  (510e74c).
- 500ms settle delay between `paste-buffer` and `send-keys Enter` so
  the TUI ingests the paste before the submit keystroke (f01c370).
- Probe backspaced on `DeltaTUINoise` so probes don't accumulate
  during long agent-busy stretches (cd969ea).

### Tests

- Concurrent regression for cap-as-ceiling property
  (`internal/store/messages_concurrent_test.go`).
- Wire-shape contract tests for `trackResult` (CLI/MCP byte-identity
  + `omitempty` contract).
- Verdict regression tests for the probe-and-watch gate, including
  the rendering-cursor-elsewhere case from the 2026-05-31 Bosun
  incident.

### Operator surface

- Documentation, README, install path documented for alcatraz.
- Forgejo Actions CI workflow (without `-race` — CI runner lacks
  cgo; local pre-commit uses `-race`).

### Known limitations

- `discover` matches `--resume` argument values verbatim; canonical
  short names (`bosun`, etc.) don't auto-resolve to long names
  (`Master Bosun of Nimbus`). Operator workaround: `semaphore.register
  name=<canonical> force=true` after a tmux restore. Tracked as #38.
- Silent pane drift at delivery time isn't caught by auto-heal —
  the existing recovery only fires on "can't find pane" errors.
  Tracked as #37.
